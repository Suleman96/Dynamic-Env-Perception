# Master_Thesis
This repository contains the necessary codes information and algorithm collected for obstacle detection


# Appearance Based Detection
## Model Implemented
The state-of-the-art model implemented for obstacle detectiona are as follows:  
- YOLOv8 (âœ”)
- Detectron2
- FastSAM


# Depth Based Algorithm
Models used for relative depth estimation are as follows:
- MiDAS 3.1
- Depth Anything
- Depth Anything V2 (To be Implemented)

# Hardware used
## For Training Models
-  AMD Ryzen 7 6800H + NVIDIA GeForce 3060 GPU GDDR6 @ 6GB

## For Inference and Testing Models 
The models selected were tested in the selected hardware to check its utility in a Real-Time Environment
- Jetson Nano Developer Kit 4GB
  - [Ubuntu 20 for Jetson Nano](https://github.com/Qengineering/Jetson-Nano-Ubuntu-20-image) with preinstalled requirements
